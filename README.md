## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to build a complete, portfolio-ready e-commerce front-end experience. It showcases proficiency in React, state management with Hooks, component-based architecture, and creating a fully responsive user interface.

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Full E-commerce Functionality:** Browse products, view details, and manage a complete shopping cart.
- **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** Add items, update quantities in real-time, remove products individually, and clear the entire cart.
- **State Persistence:** The shopping cart's state is saved to `localStorage`, meaning the user's session is preserved even after closing or reloading the browser.
- **Product Search:** A functional search bar in the header allows users to easily find products.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless user experience on all devices, from smartphones to desktops.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes `react-router-dom` for a smooth, single-page application (SPA) feel across all sections (Home, Products, About, Cart, etc.).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** Core front-end library for building the UI.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** Modern build tool for a fast and efficient development experience.
- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/):** Handles all client-side routing.
- **CSS:** Styled with pure CSS using variables for easy theme management and consistency.
- **`localStorage` API:** Used for browser-side data persistence.
